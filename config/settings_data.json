It defines the shutter speed and lens opening according to\n\tthe light conditions. If the scene is unevenly lit, then the picture will be\n\tunevenly exposed, being either too bright or too dark.

Then quickly place the picture in a bag, pocket, book or let it\n\tdevelop face down (be careful to not bend it).\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\tAvoid exposing and developing in direct sunlight; this will cause overexposure\n\tand reddening of the final result.

The long development process\n\tis mainly caused by the so-called opacification layer.
